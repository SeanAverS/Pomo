# Pomo
First Ever Project - A Pomodoro starting at 25 minutes with a 5 minute break.

What I learned 
- Keep track of function calls within other functions(hardest part)
- Keep track of a global variables value changing within functions (the 'counter' variable)

School is why there's a huge time gap before my final commits. School however taught me how to actually use eventListeners and Intervals properly so that gap was worth it to me.

As it says first ever project, a lot of things to manage(sorry for the messy code), but making atleast a little bit of progress each time I sat down made me excited to keep working at it. Hope I feel the same relief/happiness I do now as I continue my coding journey.
 
Improvements and Features
- Have a function where you can set the Work or Break time yourself 
- Don't make the 'counter' variable responsible for running most of the functions(boolean inside function to run them instead)
